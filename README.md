# RubiksCubeSolver
A Rubik's Cube has 43 Quintillion different scrambles. However, each and every one can be solved in 20 moves or less. This repository is about creating programs capable of determining the exact "algorithm" or sequence of moves to solve any scrambled cube.

# Fundamentals

- A Rubik's Cube has 6 sides
- Each side has three possible moves
  -   1 turn or 90 degrees
  -   2 turns or 180 degrees
  -   3 turns clockwise / 1 turn counter clockwise or 270 degrees)
